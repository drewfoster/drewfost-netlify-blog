> Removal of the default fund option... will significantly reduce the number of new members a fund is able to acquire in a given year.





## What is happening?

At the end of May 2018, the Productivity Commission published a draft paper on Australia's super industry aimed at tackling the increasing problem of workers holding multiple super funds and thus paying too much in fees and doubling up on insurance, amongst other issues. One suggestion to tackle this problem is to remove the default fund selection from the employer, essentially making it most likely that a new employee will opt to have their super contributions paid into an existing fund rather than opting for the new employer's default fund.

By taking control of their member data, using that data to drive insights and actions and taking ownership of their member experience, forward-looking funds are setting themselves up for success, regardless of what the Productivity Commission implements.

## Why is this necessary?

According to the Productivity Commission there are 474,000 new workers enter the workforce each year and 1.6 million either change jobs or re-enter. Currently, 2 thirds of those people join their new employer's default super fund, regardless of whether they have an existing fund. This means they potentially miss out on lower fees as a result of higher balances, and could double up on insurances that they may not be able to claim (for example, there are caps on how much income protection you can claim).



By the age of 40, nearly 1 in 2 employees will have 2+ super funds.

Under the Commission's proposal, new employees would see big changes (Source: Superannuation: Assessing Efficiency and Competitiveness). One of the proposals (perhaps the most likely), is that rather than filling out paperwork to join the employer's default fund on the first day of a new job, the employee could instead be directed to an online portal, run by the ATO, where they would select one of their existing funds for contributions to be paid into. This may seem like a minor change, but this will significantly reduce the number of people opening new accounts. They may even have the option to merge their funds, creating a retention risk as members look to consolidate accounts.



## What will this mean for super funds?

Starting a new job has traditionally been a key entry point for new members into funds. Removal of the default fund option at a new employer and instead guiding contributions into an existing fund will significantly reduce the number of new members a fund is able to acquire in a given year.



Likelihood of switching financial providers in the next 1-2 years

According to a report Salesforce commissioned from Deloitte Digital earlier this year, only 17% of those interviewed indicated that they were likely to switch Superannuation funds over the upcoming 2 years, compared to 54% who said they were unlikely/highly unlikely to switch. These figures are before any changes to default fund rules which remove the biggest catalyst for super switching. This could grant an advantage to those industry and retail funds aligned with entry level jobs in industries such as Retail, Hospitality, Food Services and Construction. It will also place far greater emphasis on the retention of those members, because, if they can keep them happy, it is now far more likely they will be able to keep their loyalty, and business, for life.



All is not lost though. The same report from Deloitte Digital did suggest a few areas where Super funds could differentiate and increase the likelihood of a member switching.



Aspects that would make customers more likely to switch to a new provider

Aside from price, potential members highlighted better features, better customer service and the overall user experience on mobile / online. Super funds will need improve across these measures not just to attract new members, but to retain them as well. Or to get more creative in the way they market to and attract new members to differentiate themselves - like Spaceship, a mobile-first super fund marketed at tech investments, have with millennials.



How are super funds preparing for these changes?

Taking control of their member data

At the moment, many super funds use third party administrators to manage their member administration and registry systems. This, in theory, frees them up to focus on product, investment and member engagement whilst reducing administrative burden and reducing fees through economies of scale. For many though, the unwanted side effect is that many super funds have been handcuffed by a lack of access to their member data in any usable fashion.



In a world that now operates 24/7, where customer expectations are driven by the applications they can launch from their mobile phone, super funds have failed to keep up. Taking back control of their data from the third party administrators is the first step and forms the foundation for the phases that come next.



Use Data to Drive Insights and actions

Having access to data isn't enough, it needs to be consumable, and super funds need to be able to take action based upon any insights that come from that data.



Mercer are one example of what you can achieve when you use data to drive actions, and then automate to achieve scale. Mercer are able to track 5 'profitable actions' that a new member must complete within 72 days of joining or risk becoming disengaged with their retirement savings. Armed with that intelligence, they are able to initiate automated contact with the new member to coach them through those activities and actions, increasing conversion rates by as much as 40%.



Own the Member Experience

With a stronger understanding of who their members are, super funds will be well positioned to meet the requirements and expectations of their members right the way through their journey from marketing and communications to onboarding and on to client servicing.



“That’s a service we can offer our members, and a point of differentiation from other funds.” - Equip Super Annual Report

One fund that I've seen embrace this evolution is Equip Super - in their own words:



“... the Salesforce CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) platform ...gives us a 360-degree view of a member’s interests and needs throughout their working life. It means we can start with online investment advice for members in their 30s and 40s, offer personalised financial planning as they start to think about their retirement, and eventually discuss aged care options. With economic uncertainty a growing concern for many Australians, and superannuation legislation increasingly complex, there’s a real need for trustworthy, personal advice. That’s a service we can offer our members, and a point of differentiation from other funds.” Source: Equip Super Annual Report



As at the end of 2017, there were 230 super funds operating in Australia. These changes seem certain to reduce those numbers as smaller and less well performing funds cease to remain relevant and get swallowed up by merger or acquisition. As the fight for new members heats up and retention of existing members becomes key, not just to success but, to survival, those super funds who have taken back their data and are able to own the member experience will be in a superior position when it comes to differentiating their service offering.
